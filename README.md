🧑‍💻 Introduction
This project introduces the basic concepts of Java programming by demonstrating key language features. Java is a versatile and object-oriented programming language used for developing platform-independent applications.

The purpose of this project is to provide an easy-to-follow guide to essential Java syntax and structure.

🔧 Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

🟦 JDK (Java Development Kit) (version 11 or higher)
🟩 A Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, VSCode)

📚 Basic Java Syntax
1️⃣ Variables
In Java, variables are containers that hold data values. A variable must be declared before it can be used.

java
Copy code
int number = 10; // Integer variable
String name = "Java"; // String variable
2️⃣ Data Types
Java has two categories of data types:

Primitive types: int, char, boolean, double, etc.
Reference types: Objects and arrays.
java
Copy code
boolean isJavaFun = true;
double temperature = 36.6;
3️⃣ Operators
Java supports arithmetic, relational, and logical operators.

java
Copy code
int sum = 5 + 10; // Arithmetic
boolean isEqual = (5 == 5); // Relational
boolean result = (5 > 3) && (10 < 20); // Logical
4️⃣ Control Flow
Control flow statements manage the order in which instructions are executed.

🔹 If-Else Statement:
java
Copy code
if (number > 0) {
System.out.println("Positive number");
} else {
System.out.println("Negative number");
}
🔹 For Loop:
java
Copy code
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
System.out.println(i);
}
5️⃣ Methods
A method is a block of code that performs a specific task. In Java, every program must have a main method where execution begins.

java
Copy code
public static void sayHello() {
System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}
6️⃣ Classes and Objects
Java is an object-oriented language where classes are blueprints for objects.

java
Copy code
public class Dog {
String name;
int age;

    public Dog(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public void bark() {
        System.out.println(name + " is barking.");
    }

}

// Creating an object
Dog myDog = new Dog("Buddy", 3);
myDog.bark(); // Outputs: Buddy is barking.
